This is an attempt to train, on the fly, a classification model that given a list of musical albums, is capable of infering in which one of these albums would belong a hypothetical song with hypothetical features.

Example: given the complete list of the albums of The Strokes, where would I most likely find a song that is very sad but also very danceable? (hint: the model thinks it would be in Comedown Machine)
