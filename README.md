This project aims to develop an on-the-fly classification model that can predict the album to which a hypothetical song would belong based on its features. For instance, given a list of musical albums, the model can predict the most likely album for a song that is very sad yet very danceable. As an example, when applied to the complete list of The Strokes albums, the model predicts that the song would most likely belong to the album Comedown Machine.
